summary:

  #
  # GPU
  #

  # - Full-stack developer proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. I have relevant experience as a research assistant at the University of Lisbon, where I focused on forest fire modelling on GPUs. Recently, I spent two years building a remote sensor dashboard using reactive frameworks. The focus of my tech career has always been on determining the most effective way to apply a technology to specific real-world use cases.

  #
  # CLOJURE
  #

  # - Full-stack developer proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. Mostly, I am a technologist who enjoys the process of building something for users. I have been writing Clojure since late 2015 and recently had the opportunity to share the joys of Clojure by mentoring more junior engineers. Over the years, I have worked for different industries and with many technologies in the ecosystem (Reagent, Re-frame, Ring, Pedestal, Datomic, Babashka, and others).

  # - I choose to work with Clojure because of the guarantees it gives me in a professional environment. Being a functional language with an emphasis on immutability and an expressive standard library, I know I can find my way in any codebase. Being a Lisp gives it that extra touch of sophistication. However, I do believe people solve problems, not tools, so I'm always happy to work with other languages and have done so in the past. I feel comfortable working with any codebase in Typescript, Go, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and I am curious to try Erlang, Haskell, and Rust.

  #
  # FUNCTIONAL
  #

  # - I am an experienced full-stack developer proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. I have a strong passion for technology and a particular focus on leveraging functional languages to develop high-performance web services that prioritize concurrency and load handling.
  #- Primarily, I have extensive expertise in API development and data pipeline tools. However, I have been enjoying frontend development using modern technologies like React, Next.js, and Tailwind.

  #
  # GENERIC
  #

  # - I am a full-stack developer with a background in engineering fluid simulation and professional experience in Clojure(script), JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and Go. My decade-long career in web development has given me a solid understanding of how web technologies function. I work best in collaborative environments and I understand the nature of compromises that have to be made in a tech stack, given time and resource constraints.

  # - I began my career at a fluids' simulation lab, where I published a novel algorithm for forest fire simulation,  optimized for GPUs. In 2013 I joined the booming Lisbon startup scene and moved to London in 2015. I have hacked code for client demos and been a developer advocate for early stage startups, and also enjoyed working on well financed greenfield re-architectures. I believe people solve problems not tools, so I always look for the most effective solution. I tend to prioritize languages over frameworks, and I can write infrastructure as code when necessary.

  #
  # Stranded bits
  #

  - Backend focused full-stack developer with a background in engineering fluid simulation and professional experience in Clojure(script), JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Kotlin, and Go. My decade-long career in software has given me a solid understanding of how web technologies function, as well as the underlying OS and network infrastructure. I believe the best teacher is a challenging environment and collaborative teammates. # To stay current with AI trends, I’m organizing a Machine Learning study group in Leuven, with a Python focus.
