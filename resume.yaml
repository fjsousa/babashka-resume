# Summary or Objective
summary:
  #Specific to clojure/gis
  #- I'm an experienced full-stack developer proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. My background includes research assistant work at the University of Lisbon, where I focused on forest fire modeling, porting models to GPU systems, and handling GIS data. Additionally, I have practical industry experience in a remote sensing startup, contributing to the development of high-frequency audio sensors deployed near oil wells. Combining my development skills with research and industry exposure, I offer a versatile skill set in software development across diverse domains.

  # GPU
  #- Full-stack developer proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. I have relevant experience as a research assistant at the University of Lisbon, where I focused on forest fire modelling on GPUs. Recently, I spent two years building a remote sensor dashboard using reactive frameworks. The focus of my tech career has always been on determining the most effective way to apply a technology to specific real-world use cases.

  # Sophia Genetics
  #- Full-stack developer with a focus on product development. I'm proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. I have relevant experience as a research assistant at the University of Lisbon, where I focused on mathematical modelling on GPUs.
  #- Recently, I spent two years building a remote sensor dashboard using reactive frameworks and I'm also competent building impeccable HTML and CSS pages.

  #ESRI - not flagged
  #- Full-stack developer proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. I have relevant experience as a research assistant at the University of Lisbon, where I focused on forest fire modelling on GPUs with a GIS component for elevation data. Recently, I spent two years building a remote sensor dashboard using reactive frameworks and I'm also competent building impeccable HTML and CSS pages, including the layout of this CV.

  # CLOJURE
  #- Full-stack developer proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. Mostly, I am a technologist who enjoys the process of building something for users. I have been writing Clojure since late 2015 and recently had the opportunity to share the joys of Clojure by mentoring more junior engineers. Over the years, I have worked for different industries and with many technologies in the ecosystem (Reagent, Re-frame, Ring, Pedestal, Datomic, Babashka, and others).

  # CLOJURE EXTRA
  #- I choose to work with Clojure because of the guarantees it gives me in a professional environment. Being a functional language with an emphasis on immutability and an expressive standard library, I know I can find my way in any codebase. Being a Lisp gives it that extra touch of sophistication. However, I do believe people solve problems, not tools, so I'm always happy to work with other languages and have done so in the past. I feel comfortable working with any codebase in Typescript, Go, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and I am curious to try Erlang, Haskell, and Rust.

  # Somewhat GENERIC
  #- I am a full-stack developer with professional experience in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. Mostly, I am a technologist who enjoys the process of building something with a real-world use case.
  #- Recently, I spent two years working closely with founders and building a remote sensor data ingestion pipeline for AI detection of drilling issues.
  #- Recently, I spent two years building a remote sensor dashboard using reactive frameworks and I'm also competent building impeccable HTML and CSS pages.


  # Full Stack - generic
  - I am a full-stack developer with professional experience in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. My ten-year-long career in web development has given me a solid understanding of how web technologies work. I work best with a team under constraints imposed by complex real-life problems.
  - The focus of my tech career has always been on determining the most effective way to apply technology to specific real-world use cases.

  #FUNCTIONAL
  #- I am an experienced full-stack developer proficient in Clojure(script), JavaScript, and Python. I have a strong passion for technology and a particular focus on leveraging functional languages to develop high-performance web services that prioritize concurrency and load handling.
  #- Primarily, I have extensive expertise in API development and data pipeline tools. However, I have been enjoying frontend development using modern technologies like React, Next.js, and Tailwind.

  # GENERIC and verbose
  # - Full-stack developer proficient in Clojure and ClojureScript. Mostly, I am a technologist who enjoys the process of building something with a real-world use case.
  # - I began my career at a fluids' simulation lab, where I published a novel algorithm for forest fire simulation,  optimized for GPUs. In 2013 I joined the booming Lisbon startup scene and moved to London in 2015. I have hacked code for client demos and been a developer advocate for early stage startups, and also enjoyed working on well financed greenfield re-architectures. I believe people solve problems not tools, so I always look for the most effective solution. I tend to prioritize languages over frameworks, and I can write infrastructure as code when necessary.
  # - I set up Codecadre LTD for my contracting work in 2019. Besides software contracting, I’m available to work with NGOs and offer free mentoring for people from a low-income background.´
