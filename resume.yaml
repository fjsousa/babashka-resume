# Summary or Objective
summary:
  - Full-stack developer proficient in Clojure and ClojureScript. Mostly, I am a technologist who enjoys the process of building something with a real-world use case.
  - I began my career at a fluids' simulation lab, where I published a novel algorithm for forest fire simulation,  optimized for GPUs. In 2013 I joined the booming Lisbon startup scene and moved to London in 2015. I have hacked code for client demos and been a developer advocate for early stage startups, and also enjoyed working on well financed greenfield re-architectures. I believe people solve problems not tools, so I always look for the most effective solution. I tend to prioritize languages over frameworks, and I can write infrastructure as code when necessary.
  - I set up Codecadre LTD for my contracting work in 2019. Besides software contracting, I’m available to work with NGOs and offer free mentoring for people from a low-income background.
