# babashka based CV builder

My google docs cv was getting difficult to manage. I started off with a single doc that quickly multiplied into several ones, as I had to make it relevant for each position I was applying for. The problem was that I would get to a point when I would write something or find a grammar issue that then I would have to propagate through all the version. It was getting dificult to manage.

This project works like this:

I have a single resume.yaml because  it gives me the fell of a document that I can read "as a human" and still be machine readable. I chose yaml over markdown for instance because it's richer.

This resume.yaml file can have parts commented out and still allow me to propagate changes easier than in a WYSIWYG.

Based on this [figma template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1230670384525015423/Just-Another-Resume-Template) with [locofy.ai](locofy.ai) to generate markup and tailwind configuration.
